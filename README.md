# Approach

In this project, I developed a simple **Travel Booking Website** using **HTML**, focusing on creating a clean and user-friendly interface that enables visitors to easily explore travel destinations and book their trips. 
The website is structured using **semantic HTML tags** to enhance accessibility, improve SEO performance, and ensure the page is well-organized for both developers and end-users.

### 1. **Header Section**:
   - The **header** is an essential part of any website's layout, serving as the introduction to the site. In this project, I used a **navigation bar** to help users easily access key pages like *Home*, *Destinations*, *Contact Us*, and *About Us*. These links are structured using an unordered list (`<ul>`) inside a `<nav>` element for better accessibility and organization.
   - **Navigation bar**: This section helps the user quickly jump to different parts of the website without excessive scrolling. The use of `<ul>` ensures the list is clear and easy to maintain.

### 2. **Main Section**:
   - The **Main Section** serves as the core content of the website and is divided into several sub-sections:
   
   - **Introduction**:
     - The **Introduction** section contains a heading and a brief paragraph outlining the websiteâ€™s services and its goal of simplifying travel planning. 
     - Using the `<section>` tag helps to logically divide content into meaningful blocks, making it easier to navigate.
   
   - **Top Destinations**:
     - This section features an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display **three popular travel destinations**. Each destination is represented by a list item (`<li>`), which includes an image (`<img>`) and a brief description. 
     - I used images for each destination to create a visually appealing layout and allow users to quickly identify the destinations. Each destination description highlights key aspects of the place, encouraging users to learn more or consider it for their trip.

   - **Travel Package Section**:
     - The **Travel Package Section** showcases a table (`<table>`) with travel packages that users can browse through. The table contains columns like Package Name, Destination, Price, and Duration. 
     - I chose a **table** to display this information because it is the most efficient way to present structured data in rows and columns, making it visually digestible.

   - **Travel Booking Form**:
     - The **Travel Booking Form** allows users to input personal information, select a travel destination, choose their preferred travel class (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class), and opt for additional services like **Insurance** or **Meal Plan**.
     - This form contains several input elements:
       - **Text Input** for Name
       - **Email Input** for users to provide their email address
       - **Dropdown Menu** (`<select>`) for choosing the destination
       - **Radio Buttons** for selecting the travel class
       - **Checkboxes** for selecting additional services
     - The form uses the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags to group related form elements, which makes the form easier to read and more accessible.
     - A **submit button** is provided for users to submit their selections.

### 3. **Footer Section**:
   - The **Footer Section** is placed at the bottom of the page and contains important information such as **contact details** and **social media links**. 
   - The use of **semantic tags** like `<footer>` makes the footer section easy to identify and distinguish from other parts of the page, improving the structure and usability of the website.
